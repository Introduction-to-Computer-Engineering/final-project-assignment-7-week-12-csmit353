**This first java script file contains code that controls three external LEDs. For this program, the microbit LED screen is disabled so pins 6, 8, and 9 can be used for i/o's.**

### enable-matrix.js

**Next I edited the previous code to enable microbit's LED screen. A smiley face was added to display the LED screen is active and working correctly. Additionally, the pins for the external LED's were changed to pins 8, 12, and 16. Otherwise, the microbit LED screen spazzes out, and no one wants that.**

### twenty-eight.js

**This file runs a microbit LED screen animation at the same time the external LED's are running. An issue I ran into was getting the microbit animation and LED lights to run simultaneously, instead of in sequence.**
